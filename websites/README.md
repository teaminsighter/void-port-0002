## Folder Naming Convention

```
kebab-case/          (e.g. real-estate, saas-landing, restaurant, portfolio)
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
├── config.js        ← client edits this only
├── robots.txt
├── sitemap.xml
└── 404.html
```

Each project is self-contained — no shared dependencies between folders.
